# Overview

What follows is an overview of Chess’s data types and its API: pokes, subscription paths, and scry endpoints.

If you’re an app developer looking to integrate your app with Chess, these docs should contain everything you need to know.

If you’d like to [contribute to Chess](https://github.com/thecommons-urbit/chess/issues) itself, consider these docs a primer. The [backend code](https://github.com/thecommons-urbit/chess/tree/develop/src/urbit) is thoroughly commented, and you should read that next.
