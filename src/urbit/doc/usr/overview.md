Chess is a fully decentralized, peer-to-peer Chess app. Its original version was one of the first Urbit apps, created by ~sigryn-habrex.

This version, forked and maintained by ~finmep-lanteb, was one of the first Urbit apps to ship on the fully-fledged software distribution system in 2021. It has since been updated by [The Commons](https://github.com/thecommons-urbit), founded by alumni of the first Hoon School and App School cohorts taught by the Urbit Foundation.

This guide includes a Changelog, a user manual for Players, and a high-level overview of the code for Developers.
